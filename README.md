This is a small programm to detect and recognise faces using python. 

Even though the programm is fairly easy, it may have some difficulties when developing it for the first time as you get familiar with the libraries that are required. 

In order to detect known faces you need to create a folder inside of your repository  with the name "faces" (If you want to change the name of the folder you will need to change the path in the code).
